# All-in-good-Waste
Engineering Design Project 

# Objective 
The objective of the project was to create a machine that precisely and efficiently sorts through trash. My group had the goal of making the University of Waterloo a cleaner, more eco-friendly community while also being efficient for our busy students to use.
Studies show that only 9% of plastic is accuratley sorted. In order to fix this issue, the machine needed to properly distinguish between glass, carboard, paper and plstic, transport the garbage to its correct bin and dispose of it properly
