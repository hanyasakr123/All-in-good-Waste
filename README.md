# All-in-good-Waste
Engineering Design Project 

# Objective 
The objective of the project was to create a machine that precisely and efficiently sorts through trash. My group had the goal of making the University of Waterloo a cleaner, more eco-friendly community while also being efficient for our busy students to use.
Studies show that only 9% of plastic is accurately sorted. In order to fix this issue, the machine needed to properly distinguish between glass, cardboard, paper and plastic, transport the garbage to its correct bin and dispose of it properly

# Software Components
- Lobe.AI: 2500 images were downloaded to the platform to distinguish between types of trash and 94% accuracy in sorting trash was obtained
- Terminal: Running machine learning aspect of the Raspberry Pi
- Image Processing: Pictures using the Raspberry Pi camera is taken and sent back to the terminal for processing

# Hardware Components 
- Raspberry Pi (including breadboard, push buttons to activate sortor and camera, jumper wires to connect push buttons to motor)
- Camera Board 
- Motor to move trash to its proper bin
- SD Card
- USB-C power supply

# Process
Over the course of six weeks, we were able to: 
- set up a Raspberry Pi to the internet and download 2500 pics of recycling from Lobe.A. 
- install Winspc and VNV viewer to communicate with Raspberry PI. 
- train the computer to reach 94% accuracy.
- attach a functioning camera that recognizes and sorts trash,
- and connect a motor to move left/right depending on the category of recycling and dispose of it in its proper bin.
